# MNIST CNN

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

This project is built for learning purposes — focusing on understanding how CNNs work.

The goal here is to understand how a simple CNN works, and to play around with hyper-parameters and making an ensemble model.

## Organization

- `/notebooks` - contains `jupyter-notebooks`, you should go over them in order
	- first one is making the first CNN, 
	- the second is for trying differnt hyper-paramters
	- the third is for making a ensemble model

## Data set
We use the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, consisting of:

- 60,000 training images

- 10,000 test images

- 28x28 grayscale images

- 10 classes (digits 0–9)
